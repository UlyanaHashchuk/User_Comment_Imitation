## Info

### "User Comment Imitation"

You have a textarea, where you can write some `comment`. After pushing `Save` button you will see your `comment` below.

- If `comment` exceed `maxSize`, the `comment` will be truncated and you will see `Show more` buttom.
- Push `Show more` button and check full `comment`. Then `Show less` button will appear, which allows to truncate(hide) `comment` again.
- If you add `link` in your `comment` starting with `http | https | www`, it will be transformed into the `<a>` tag and you will be able to click on it and be redirected on webpage due to `link`.
- If your `link` was truncated it still will be clickable and will be working.

You can also choose `color theme` which will change `background-color` and `color`!
